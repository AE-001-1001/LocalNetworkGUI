# LocalNetworkGUI
This is a python based, network sniffer, and other miscellaneous functions.
# [Proof Of Application](https://github.com/AE-001-1001/LocalNetworkGUI/assets/102845355/4be510aa-b112-4637-8b86-f77150a1fe9f)
Source code is purely python, and inspired by curiosity. 
I do apologize for the rough looking GUI, and no backend so no sneaky backdoor.
Be sure to do your due diligence, when running any script from another,
as you do not know their intentions.

The concept whenever this was created, was created everything in python
then make it an executable, and run it on a windows machine.
It is not the most efficient, but it is a proof of concept.
