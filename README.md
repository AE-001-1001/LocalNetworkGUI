# LocalNetworkGUI
This is a python based, network sniffer, and other miscellaneous functions. Using this requires credit to AE-001-1001
# [Proof Of Application](https://github.com/AE-001-1001/LocalNetworkGUI/wiki)
Source code is purely python, and inspired by curiosity. 
I do apologize for the rough looking GUI, and no backend so no sneaky backdoor.
Be sure to do your due diligence, when running any script from another,
as you do not know their intentions.

The concept whenever this was created, was created everything in python
then make it an executable, and run it on a windows machine.
It is not the most efficient, but it is a proof of concept.

Also the speedtest.exe is from the direct website, as you can goto the domain listed in the source and it would show the legitimate website.
